                Hello! I'm Gael Escobar Cruz. I created this website just to create it.
                I want to become a web developer. I have been learning HTML and CSS for the past two and a half months
                and have been trying to use the new skills that I aqquired to make this website and many more in the
                fututre.
                My goal by the end of my first year in college is to become a front end web developer.
                I know it might out of reach, but that's what I'm working towards, so Im going to keep working and
                on projects and practicing my skills.
            </p>

                I've found my passion for coding in my senior year of highschool.
                I took a web game developer course and had the most fun creating games and programs with
                JavaScript. Since then I started looking into what feild of programming i would like to
                get into. I then Web Development and fell in love with the process of creating websites.
                This is going to be my firls "real" web page that I'm making on my own. I'm taking my tim ewith it to
                really make
                it into something special.
